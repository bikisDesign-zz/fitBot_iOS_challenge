# Fitbot iOS Coding Challenge

## To Install
Git Clone   
cd FitBot_Activity_Tracker/FitBot_Activity_Tracker  
carthage bootstrap  
- This will install a few carthage dependenices

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get a good sense of how you like to build something people love to use. Complete the challenge using your preferred style of code and with the aim that you would expect to pick this up and work on it again in a few months. Write code that is not only useful but you would be proud of. 

## Values

* We use Swift and Xcode so please do the same
* We value highly reusable, well-formatted code with complimentary tests
* We value the open source community and use third party libraries when they help prevent reinventing the wheel and make sense to use over first party support but...
* First party support is the bedrock we build on so show that you are adept at Cocoa Touch
* Stack Overflow and other sources are available to support and provide guidance, but only with proper attribution. Don’t plagiarize!
* At Fitbot we don’t use Storyboards and create UI in code but you may use them for the challenge if you prefer

## The Project

You are tasked with building a simple activity tracking app using the [Strava Activities API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/#api-Activities). You can create any kind of activity you want such as running, cycling, walking, hiking, etc. This project is intended to be minimal in scope and is designed specifically to test how a candidate thinks through architectural decisions, executes solutions, and iOS proficiency.

### Requirements

The app should track a minimum amount of data such as:
* Total time
* Distance in feet
* Date of activity

The app should have at a minimum:
* An area to record new activities
* Show a list of past activities
* A detailed view of a past activity

## Submission

You have a week to complete the exercise. The project is open ended but don’t rush to completion to send something without polish. You should spend up to 10 hours on this.

When you’re finished commit the project to Github where we can access it. If there are special instructions or installation needs document them appropriately in a README. Send us an email that you’re done with a link to the repo.

Feel free to surprise us and remember to have fun!

Please reach out to aj@thefitbot.com if you have any questions.
